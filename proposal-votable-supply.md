### What makes your Alliance best-suited to execute this Mission?

Our Alliance is uniquely equipped to execute this Mission, combining both prior experience and complementary skills that are directly applicable to the task. We recently developed the Voting Influence and Concentration Analysis (VICA), a model tailored for the Optimism Collective, which provides a systematic framework for analyzing voting concentration, influence distribution, and governance risks. This model used a combination of network analysis, logistic regression, and counterfactual analysis to estimate voting blocs' influence and to develop concentration metrics. The skills and insights gained through VICA are directly transferable to this new mission’s objectives, as both projects address governance, risk of voting concentration, and the resilience of decentralization structures.

Our team consists of:

Bilal Bai, a seasoned quantitative analyst and certified risk manager with extensive experience in scenario analysis, stress test, sensitivity analysis, and risk factor modeling. 

Yujie Yang, a PhD candidate in statistics at the University of Hong Kong, brings deep knowledge in the theory and application of complex networks and statistical modeling, providing a strong foundation for data analysis and network-based insights.

Together, our team’s experience in governance metrics, concentration analysis, and network-based risk assessment uniquely qualifies us to develop a dynamic model for votable supply projections, addressing both the decentralization targets and the associated governance attack risks.

### Please describe your proposed solution based on the above Solution Criteria (if applicable):

The VICA model laid the groundwork for understanding how voting concentration affects governance stability, making it an ideal foundation for this project. By applying VICA’s clustering algorithms, influence metrics and concentration analysis, we can more accurately determine the votable supply required to minimize governance risks. Moreover, VICA’s counterfactual scenarios and sensitivity analysis have provided valuable insights into network behavior under different assumptions, which will inform our dynamic projections and cost of attack modeling.

##### Solution Components
   - **Risk Factor Identification**: Building on VICA’s clustering analysis, influence and concentration metrics, we will perform a thorough risk factor analysis to identify key variables that could impact the cost of attack and governance security. This includes understanding token liquidity, voter turnout, market volatility, and potential governance vulnerabilities. By analyzing these risk factors, we aim to capture potential points of failure or concentration that could threaten the system's integrity. We will also consider the correlation across different factors.
   - **Scenario Analysis**: We will extend VICA’s counterfactual capabilities to conduct scenario analysis that simulate various conditions of token distribution, market conditions, and governance participation rates. Each scenario will assess how changes in these factors impact the system's decentralization targets and the cost of attack. The goal is to create a flexible model that provides insight into how different scenarios affect votable supply targets and governance resilience.
   - **Stress Testing**: To ensure the model's robustness, we will conduct stress tests under extreme conditions, such as sudden changes in token liquidity, sharp declines in voter turnout, or large-scale token concentration in few hands. These tests will provide insights into the model's ability to handle shocks and sustain a high cost of attack even under adverse conditions. Stress tests will enable the Foundation to gauge the system’s resilience against governance risks and adjust targets accordingly.


### Please outline your step-by-step plan to execute this Mission, including expected deadlines to complete each peice of work:

Execution Plan:

- Stage 1: Preparatory Research and Data Collection
- Stage 2: Risk Factors Identification and Initial Cost of Attack Analysis
- Stage 3: Model Development and Sensitivity Analysis
- Stage 4: Final Reporting and Adaptive Model Delivery

### Please define the critical milestone(s) that should be used to determine whether you’ve executed on this proposal:

- Initial Data Analysis and Risk Factors Identification: Early-stage feedback on the relevancy and robustness of identified attack vectors and votable supply projections.
- Prototype Development: A functional model prototype, tested with dummy and real data, to validate votable supply targets.
- Final Adaptive Model: A fully developed model and report, delivered for the Foundation's review and ready for scenario-based forecasting.

### Please list any additional support your team would require to execute this mission (financial, technical, etc.):

To ensure the accuracy and applicability of our model, we request ongoing communication with the Optimism team to gain insights into token distribution plans, governance changes, and voting behavior patterns.

### Grants are awarded in OP, locked for one year. Please let us know if access to upfront capital is a barrier to completing your Mission and you would like to be considered for a small upfront cash grant: (Note: there is no guarantee that approved Missions will receive up-front cash grants.)
